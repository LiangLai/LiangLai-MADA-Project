Raw data access

The raw data used in this project come from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the RAND HRS Longitudinal File. Due to data use agreements and file size limitations, the raw Stata data files are not included in this GitHub repository.

Researchers can obtain the data directly from the HRS website (https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/
) after registering for an account and agreeing to the data use terms.

Once downloaded, the raw .dta files should be placed in the data/raw/ directory following the folder structure described above. All scripts in this repository assume this directory structure and use relative paths via the here() package.
